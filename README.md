# Lab 7 â€” Recipe Book Application: Authentication with Devise

## Objective
Extend the Recipe Book application from the previous lab by adding **user authentication** using the **Devise** gem.  
By the end of this lab, users should be able to sign up, log in, and manage their session securely.  

This lab reinforces:
- Integrating external gems into a Rails project.
- Setting up Devise for user authentication.
- Restricting access to certain pages for authenticated users.

## Instructions
1. **Add Devise to the Application**
   - Integrate **Devise** into your project and complete the required setup.
   - Make sure the configuration steps are correctly followed so that authentication views and routes work properly.

2. **Create the User Model**
   - Generate a `User` model using Devise.
   - Run the necessary migrations to create the users table.
   - Verify that the login and registration flows work as expected.

3. **Associate Recipes with Users**
   - Add a reference from recipes to users so that each recipe belongs to a specific user.
   - Update model relationships:
     - A user can have many recipes.
     - Each recipe belongs to a user.

4. **Restrict Access**
   - Ensure that only authenticated users can create, edit, or delete recipes.
   - Visitors who are not logged in should still be able to view the list of recipes and read individual recipe details.
   - Use built-in Devise helpers to manage access control.

5. **User Interface**
   - Add navigation links for **Sign up**, **Log in**, and **Log out**.
   - Display the logged-in userâ€™s email or name in the navigation bar.
   - **Customize Devise views** to match the look & feel of your Recipe Book application (using your existing layout, Bootstrap styles, and consistent navigation).
   - Optionally, show only the recipes created by the logged-in user on the index page.

## Deliverables
- Recipe Book application extended with authentication using Devise.
- Users can register, log in, and log out successfully.
- Only authenticated users can create, edit, or delete recipes.
- Public users can view the list of recipes.
- Navigation updated to include authentication links.

# Lab 6 â€” Recipe Book Application

## Objective
Build a complete **Ruby on Rails** application for managing a personal recipe book.  
The application must implement a full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for a single model and use **ActionText** for rich text content.

This lab consolidates what you have learned so far:
- Building models, controllers, and views in Rails.
- Using **PostgreSQL** as the database.
- Styling with **Bootstrap**.
- Adding **ActionText** for rich text fields.
- Implementing full CRUD functionality (`index`, `show`, `new`, `edit`, `destroy`).

## Instructions
1. **Model**
   - Create a `Recipe` model with the following attributes:
     - `title` (string): the name of the recipe.
     - `cook_time` (integer): preparation time in minutes.
     - `difficulty` (string): level of difficulty (e.g., "Easy", "Medium", "Hard").
     - `instructions` (ActionText): detailed cooking instructions with formatted text, links, and images.

2. **Database**
   - Use **PostgreSQL** as the database engine.

3. **Interface and Styling**
   - Style all views with **Bootstrap**.
   - Add a navigation bar with links to the list of recipes and the form for creating a new recipe.

4. **CRUD Functionality**
   - **Index view**: list all recipes showing their title, cook time, and difficulty.
   - **Show view**: display full details of a recipe, including the rich text instructions.
   - **New view**: form to add a new recipe.
   - **Edit view**: form to edit an existing recipe.
   - **Destroy action**: option to delete a recipe with confirmation, redirecting to the index.

## Deliverables
- A fully working Rails application implementing the recipe book.
- All views styled with Bootstrap.
- ActionText correctly set up for the `instructions` field.
- Clean and organized code, following Rails conventions.
